radio

An interactive customizable radio station

=====

Radio is a project that allows groups to share youtube video's, audio files, vocaroo's, images, links, and have conversations. The original instance of this is located at esfores.com. For everyone that would like to install this onto their website, here are the instructions to install it.

1. Install the files into the target directory.

2. Insert the sql file into your database.

3. Alter the connect.php file to match your database information.

4. Set your host settings. At the very least, set a background image to replace the ugly white background. Host settings can be set at YOURDIRECTORY/view/host.php

5. Set passwords. As default, 1234 is the admin password. For security reasons, this can only be changed through direct database access. You can add temporary users and upcoming events at the following page YOURDIRECTORY/view/master.php

You should now be set up. If you have any issues, feel free to contact me. goosepostbox@gmail.com
